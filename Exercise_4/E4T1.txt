Task 1 - Remediation plan

1. Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an SSH brute force attack from the internet.

a. Do not allow ssh from the public internet to the ec2 instances. If it is required, we can have a security hardened bastion host in public subnet through 
which user can access the application servers. 
b. Disable ssh password login on application server and only allows ssh keys for login
c. Restrict network traffic that can flow into  application server   
d.We can also automatically block malicious IP addresses based on ssh brute force alerts based on the aws references below.

We can also use a combination of Guardduty, WAF, Lambda and other AWS components to automatically block suspicious hosts. Below article referenced for the same.

2. Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket; even in the instance that API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented 
access to sensitive data?

a.  API are long-term credentials that are not automatically rotated and could have a significant business impact if they are compromised.
So, API access should be disabled and only an IAM role should be used to manage temporary credentials for applications or services that need to access Amazon S3.
Besides this, the current policy (InstanceRolePolicy) attached to instance role is not restrictive as it allows all operations on all resources(buckets). So, this 
policy should be updated so that instance role can only read contents of "free recipe bucket".

b. we can also implement bucket policy on secret recipe bucket to deny access to all except "priveleged business users".
