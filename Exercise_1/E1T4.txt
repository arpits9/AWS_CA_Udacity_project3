1. EC2 instances vulnerabilties -
	a. WebAppSG - Ingress traffic is allowed on all ports (sg-0bf1708088447c5e1), but application only needs port 5000 to be open. 
	HTTP	TCP	80	0.0.0.0/0	–
	All traffic	All	All	0.0.0.0/0	–
	SSH	TCP	22	0.0.0.0/0	–
	Custom TCP	TCP	5000	0.0.0.0/0	–

	this will allow bad actors to exploit this vulnerabilty and they can  reach out to EC2 application instance in public subnet via external or internal medium and perform malacious activities.

	b. EBS disks attached to both the EC2 instances are not encrypted. 
	c. NACL - Both public and private subnet rules allow all traffic on all ports from all ports.   
	d. Route table - IGW is attached to both the private and public subnet. A subnet is not private if it has routes to/from the Internet. So, IGW shoud not be attached to private subnet. If Egress traffic needs to be enabled, then NAT gateway should be attached to the private subnet.   

2. S3 buckets
	a. All the 3 S3 buckets are not encrypted and also "Block public access" setting is off which is not a good security practice. 
	b. InstanceRolePolicy-C3  - This policy is not restrictive at all . The policy does not follow the principle of least privilege and bad actor can exploit this vulnerabilty.
